<body>
  <p>My name is Christopher Simonetti and I am a Graphic Design major at Miami International University of Art and Design.
  I enjoy music a lot, along with skateboarding and cars. I am from New York originally and moved to Jacksonville, Florida
  when I was 11 years old. I attended high school at Allen D. Nease High School in Ponte Vedra, Florida and played baseball.
  Bye.</p>
